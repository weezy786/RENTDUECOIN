# Rent Due Coin ($RENTDUE)

**Welcome to the official GitHub repo for Rent Due Coin – the world’s first utility meme coin for rent payments.**

---

## 💡 What is Rent Due Coin?
Rent Due Coin ($RENTDUE) is a Solana-based cryptocurrency designed to make rent payments faster, cheaper, and borderless. We're removing banks and middlemen from the process by leveraging blockchain technology.

## 📱 Rent Tracker App (Coming Soon)
We are currently developing the **Rent Tracker** MVP – a simple, user-friendly dApp to:
- Send and receive rent payments in $RENTDUE
- Set rent reminders
- View payment history
- Stake and earn rewards

Expected launch: **Q3 2025**
